# Project Setup
1. Create a new project folder: make sure to Integrate JavaScript and an external API
2. Create a new GitHub repository.
3. Regularly commit to the repository.

# Requirements
1. Text editor
2. Node environment

# Project Requirements
1. Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS/Bootstrap or Tailwind frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format.

2. Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

3. Your app needs to incorporate at least 3 separate event listeners (DOMContentLoaded, click, change, submit, etc).

4. Some interactivity is required. This could be as simple as adding a "like" button or adding comments. These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page.

5. Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.

# Implementing a mini web app
The project enables the user to:
1. As a user I can see a menu of Dog breeds when the page loads.
2. As a user I can click on a Dog breed to display its details like image and characteristics
3. As a user I can click on the like symbol to like the dog breed that seems to impress me.
4. As a user I can search for a Dog breed by typing its name on the search bar
